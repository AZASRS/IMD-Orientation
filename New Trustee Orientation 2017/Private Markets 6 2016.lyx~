Investment strategies and diversification benefits are unique to each asset

Real estate (and we believe the closely related infrastructure and agriculture
 activities) is generally regarded a distinct asset class with its own risk

\begin_layout Quote
Although there is commonality with both stocks and bonds, the majority of
 real estate risk is driven by endogenous factors.
 Ultimately, real estate is its own asset class.

\begin_layout Itemize
In the case of private equity and private debt, we consider them extensions
 of the related equity and fixed income asset classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We invest in private equity in order to pursue specialized strategies and
 to expand the opportunity set to include firms not listed on public exchanges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We invest in private debt largely because of favorable risk/return characteristi
cs due to dislocations resulting from increased regulatory restrictions
 on commercial bank lending and the opportunities created thereby.

The Legal Structure of Private Markets Investments
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Private markets investments are normally made by purchasing a partnership
 interest or membership interest in an LLC.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Partnership and LLC structures are functionally equivalent and lawyers represent
ing ASRS consider either to be acceptable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For simplicity, we will use partnership terms in this presentation.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
These partnerships are normally managed by a general partner responsible
 for the business operations of the partnership.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These partnerships are in various forms which are discussed in this section.

Separate Accounts
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A separate account is a partnership formed to make investments in which
 ASRS is the only investor other than the general partner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As the sole investor, ASRS is ordinarily able to negotiate bespoke terms
 including:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
liquidity rights including the ability to terminate the investment period
 and commence liquidation, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
customized investment parameters, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
accordion features allowing the investment to be increased,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
enhanced information and monitoring features,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and customized fee arrangements.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
These are usually implemented as evergreen structures intended as long term
 relationships, but with termination rights favoring ASRS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The separate account has become the dominant form for ASRS private markets
 investing.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Closed end funds (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CEFs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) are partnerships with many limited partners organized by a GP to pursue
 a business strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CEFs are the dominant form of legal organization for private equity and
 much of real estate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CEFs have the following features:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Finite life, typically 10 to 15 years including
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
an investment period of 3 to 5 years
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a harvest period of 5 to 7 years plus optional extensions, 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Strong control by the GP with little influence available to LPs, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Funding commitments are legally binding on the LPs.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
CEFs have the advantage of strong commitment of the partnership group to
 each other creating certainty about the continued availability of funds
 to pursue a strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But CEFs have weak governance from the perspective of the LP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ASRS uses CEFs in its private equity portfolio where they are the only viable
 option for pursuing the strategy and on a limited basis in the real estate
 portfolio for certain specialized strategies.

Features of an open end fund include:
\end_layout

Organized for an indefinite time period,
\end_layout

New partners are admitted from time to time and buy in at current asset

Co-investments are investments, typically at reduced or no fees, alongside

They are offered as a benefit to larger limited partners who have the infrastruc

\begin_layout Itemize
Typically on a single investment which is usually too large to be accommodated
 in the sponsoring fund.

Held in a partnership of one managed by the GP which controls all business

\begin_layout Itemize
ASRS has executed a number of co-investments with its GPs and Co-investments

\begin_layout Quotation

\size footnotesize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By selecting the NFI-ODCE as benchmark, the ASRS considers this benchmark
 as an opportunity cost, not a model portfolio.
 The ASRS expects that its portfolio will vary significantly from the ODCE
 index.
 The ASRS will manage its investments actively and dynamically in the real
 estate asset class in order to target a net return expectation of 8%.
 The 8% net objective represents a significant premium over the 6.5% net
 long term expectation for passive, stable, equity real estate positions.

Private Debt Overview
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Private Debt is comprised of illiquid loans and bonds that typically fund
 highly leveraged companies and real estate properties that are typically
 too small in size to meet the requirements of the tradable leveraged loan,
 high yield bond, or commercial mortgage-backed securities markets.
 For example, Private Debt may consist of secured loans funding leveraged
 buyouts of small to mid-size companies or mezzanine financing for real
 estate properties.
 Returns in the asset class are determined by: 1) the expected returns of
 individual investments (based on the cash coupon rate or spread over LIBOR
 and other sources of return including underwriting fees, original issuance
 discounts and premium call features) and 2) the actual level of credit
 losses experienced in the underlying portfolios.

\begin_layout Itemize
IMD House View: Private Debt offers the most attractive opportunity in the
 fixed income markets with double-digit yields readily available for investors
 willing to accept illiquidity.
 The market opportunity is principally driven by regulatory constraints
 that make it unattractive for banks to hold illiquid loans or other debt
 of below investment-grade credit quality.
